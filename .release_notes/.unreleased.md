## Breaking Changes

The default POSIX profile has been renamed from `default` to `__filesystem__`. If your code or configuration explicitly sets `profile="default"`, please update it to `profile="__filesystem__"` (or remove the profile parameter entirely). Users who do not explicitly specify a profile, or who are not using the reserved POSIX profile, are not affected.

## New Features

- Added multi-backend configuration support, enabling datasets distributed across multiple storage backends to be accessed through a single unified profile. See configuration reference for usage details.
