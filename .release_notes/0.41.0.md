## Multi-Storage Client (MSC)

### Breaking Changes

The default POSIX profile has been renamed from `default` to `__filesystem__`. If your code or configuration explicitly sets `profile="default"`, please update it to `profile="__filesystem__"` (or remove the profile parameter entirely). Users who do not explicitly specify a profile, or who are not using the reserved POSIX profile, are not affected.

### New Features

- Added multi-backend configuration support, enabling datasets distributed across multiple storage backends to be accessed through a single unified profile. See configuration reference for usage details.
- Added size-based batching to `msc sync` operations for improved performance and resource utilization.
- Added automatic ulimit increase for high-concurrency operations to prevent file descriptor exhaustion.
- Added GCS credentials provider support for Rust client with comprehensive refactoring.
- Implemented async metrics collection to significantly reduce OpenTelemetry overhead in telemetry operations.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed `sync_from` ignoring `preserve_source_attributes` parameter when using `source_files` argument.
- Fixed directory creation race conditions on distributed filesystems by implementing proper handling of concurrent mkdir operations.

## Multi-Storage File System (MSFS)

### New Features

- Added Prometheus/Grafana integration with dashboard support for monitoring file system operations.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed cache `ttl_check_interval` validation to ensure it is always positive.
- Fixed unlocked cache prune call that could cause race conditions.
- Fixed inode eviction to properly include clean cache lines.
- Fixed missing `inode.touch()` calls in file system operations.
- Fixed Grafana dashboard job selector for metrics.
